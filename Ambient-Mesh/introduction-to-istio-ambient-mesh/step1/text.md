In Istio all outbound traffic from an istio-injected pod is redirected
automatically to its Istio sidecar proxy by default.


Therefore, the accessibility of external URLs outside the cluster depends on the configuration of the sidecar proxies.


By default, Istio proxy is configured to pass through requests for unknown services.


The Isto's `outboundTrafficPolicy` configuration option configures the way sidecar proxies handle communications
with external services, that is, those services that are or are not listed in the Istioâ€™s
internal [service registry](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#introducing-istio-traffic-management).


If the `outboundTrafficPolicy` configuration option is set to **ALLOW_ANY**,
the Istio proxies let calls to unknown services pass through, whereas if the option
is set to **REGISTRY_ONLY**, Istio proxies will block any host not listed in the internal service registry.

Currently, Istio is configured with the `outboundTrafficPolicy` option is set
to **ALLOW_ANY**.


Test that you can successfully make a request to the *httpbin* external service by running:
```bash
kubectl exec tester -- \
    curl -sS -o /dev/null -D - http://httpbin.org/status/200 | \
    grep  "HTTP/";
```{{exec}}


Your task is to update the Istio installation and use **REGISTRY_ONLY** outbound traffic policy
mode instead of **ALLOW_ANY** using `istioctl`:
```bash
istioctl install --set profile=demo \
    -y --manifests=/root/istio-${ISTIO_VERSION}/manifests \
    --set meshConfig.outboundTrafficPolicy.mode=REGISTRY_ONLY
```{{exec}}

Wait a few seconds and then retry to access *httpbin* external service:

```bash
kubectl exec tester -- \
    curl -sS -o /dev/null -D - http://httpbin.org/status/200 | \
    grep  "HTTP/";
```{{exec}}

The requests to outside services should now be blocked with message:

```text
curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
command terminated with exit code 56
```
