# Introduction

In this scenario, you will install Falco, an open-source runtime security tool, on the master node of a Kubernetes cluster. You will then deploy two applications that trigger specific Falco rules related to potential security threats. Your task will be to identify the compromised containers based on Falco alerts and mitigate the threats by scaling down the affected deployments.
