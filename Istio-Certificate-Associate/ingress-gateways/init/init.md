In this scenario, you will practice configuring Istio ingress traffic by using an ingress Gateway resource.

A Gateway serves the purpose of exposing a service beyond the boundaries of the service mesh and
provides more extensive customization and flexibility compared to a Kubernetes Ingress resource.

Furthermore, a Gateway, enables the application of Istio features, such as monitoring and routing rules,
to incoming traffic entering the cluster.
