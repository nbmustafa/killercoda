In this scenario you will practice configuring Istio to mirror traffic directed 
to a service, to another service.

Traffic mirroring allows to publish changes to production with as little risk as 
possible, by sending a copy of live traffic to a mirrored service. 

The mirrored traffic happens out of band of the critical request path for the 
primary service, and it is "fire and forget", meaning that the responses are 
discarded.
